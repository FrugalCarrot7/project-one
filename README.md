# Memory Game by James Devine

## Rules
The game begins when you press the **start** button. Once the button is pressed a random code of colors will appear for **5** seconds. Use that time to remember the code. Once the code disappears, press the color buttons in the order they appeared before. When you think you have the right answer press the **submit** button. If you guess correctly 3 times you **win**! If you get it wrong 3 times you **lose**. If you want to test your memory again press the **reset** located on the bottom right.
